This is a very simple text based RPG that is supposed to emulate some of the first RPGs that were ever created. Because of
this it is reliant entirly on user-input, as opposed to graphics and intricate animations. True retro gamers and people who
like to read will love this RPG.

Rules:
A player can type...
	1. 'help' to view a list of commands
	2. 'status' to view their character's health
	3. 'rest' to sleep and restore their health
	4. 'explore' to encounter enemies and level up
	5. 'attack' when they encounter an enemy to damage it
	6. 'flee' to run away from an enemy
	7. 'quit' to quit and game

Have fun and try not to die!!!
